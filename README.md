# to-do-list-app
This project demonstrates the basics of a modern front-end framework (React.js/Angular). The app implemented is a **To-Do List**, allowing users to **add, edit, and delete tasks**, showcasing the core features of the framework including:
- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Two-way data binding (if Angular)

## Features
- **Add Task:** Users can input a new task and add it to the list.
- **Edit Task:** Users can update an existing task.
- **Delete Task:** Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Dynamic UI:** Tasks are rendered dynamically as they are added, edited, or deleted.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-End Framework:** React.js or Angular
- **Languages:** JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS (or SCSS, optional)
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
